## Introduction

* Our team got together with the simple goal of revitalizing the charging experience for everyone. Armando Botiller, Ayush Tathi, and Manuel Castro bring their expertise in Robotics Engineering together to innovate home solutions with sensor based technology and improve day to day life.

We are making a smart outlet that can monitor power indoor and outdoor that does away with the network connectivity and latency woes that plague current market offerings.

### Project Summary

The goal of the project is to create a smart outlet with power monitoring features and voice recognition. Below are useful navigation links for this datasheet:

### Manny's Contribution

* This is a link to my [Individual Block Diagram](https://mcastr11-collab.github.io/EGR304MannyIndividualDataSheet/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) where an overview of all used components for the project will be shown in blocks, detailing power requirements, pin connections, and the components used.


To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
