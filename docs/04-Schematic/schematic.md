## Overview

This schematic is designed to comply with the Spark Guard's product requirements with time constraints, resorces, and my own abilities taken into consideration. Below are the schematics I have created for the purpose of completing the vision of our project. The device is powered from a 120V AC to 9V DC adapter, its internal components operate at 5V which is regulated via a 9VDC to 5VDC linear voltage regulator.

**Figure 1:** Final schematic.
This is my most up to date schematic in which I changed the last design a bit in order to add a push to talk function in order to add more security. The design also adds a band pass filter and it changed the supply voltage from the AC to DC converter to 9V DC. The changes add more features without overcomplicating the end result and it stays true to the voice recognition requirements.
