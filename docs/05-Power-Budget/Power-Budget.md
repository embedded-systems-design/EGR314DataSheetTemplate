## Conclusions

The completed power budget demonstrates that the system’s power distribution is well within safe operating limits. The external 12 V, 5 A power supply provides ample capacity to drive all regulators and loads simultaneously, with significant current margin remaining. The LM2596 efficiently powers the +6 V rail for the DC motor and H-bridge, while the D45V5F5 supplies a stable +5 V rail for low-power components such as the phototransistor and operational amplifier. All rails operate below their rated limits, ensuring reliable performance, minimal heat generation, and strong overall power efficiency in the design.
